# Saswara Kannada Rigveda Samhita
I have created this webpages so for Riveda chanting enthusiasts in Kannada language. Feel free to reach out to me for any corrections/feedback @dithal29@gmail.com

Two classification methods of Rigveda shaakala shaka in practice today. I have categorized my webpages to help chanters either follow Mandala method or Ashtaka method. Under each of the these two categories, I have created webpages, one with with minimum details and other with more details for each mantras.

I'm still working on proofreading the correcting the Rishi, devata and chadas chanting mantras at the begining of each suktas.
